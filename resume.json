    "summary": "I come in when products need direction and engineering needs structure.\n\nAs a Fractional CTO & CPO, I help B2B companies shape their product strategy, set up delivery teams, and make hard technical calls—fast. At reteach, I scaled the product to 300+ customers and grew ACV by 900%, building and leading a cross-functional team of 8 across engineering, design, and product.\n\nI ramp up quickly, align stakeholders across business and tech, and deliver under uncertainty. Currently, I work at the intersection of AI strategy and hands-on product engineering—from LLM integration in B2B SaaS to building full applications with agentic engineering.",
